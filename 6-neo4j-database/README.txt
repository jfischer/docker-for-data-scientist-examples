This example uses the Neo4j bulk importer to create a neo4j database. It then
starts a detached Neo4j server container on top of this database.

The graph data is from the DBLP example here: https://snap.stanford.edu/data/com-DBLP.html

Execute sh run.sh from the terminal in this location. This will start a detached container.
To kill the container and cleanup the files, run: sh cleanup.sh.
